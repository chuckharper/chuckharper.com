On that computer I learned to write programs in Apple BASIC, Logo, and did simple animation in Br&#248;derbund Fantavision. I played King&rsquo;s Quest, Karateka, Montezuma&rsquo;s Revenge and Project Space Station games and even copied a version of Snake out of a BYTE magazine.</p>
    <p>In 1994 I purchased my first Apple Macintosh computer; a Quadra 610 DOS Compatible (only 25,000 were ever manufactured). This computer had a second, Intel 486SX, CPU which allowed you run MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 on the same hardware as Mac OS 7.1. The DOS Compatiblity card could have it&rsquo;s own RAM card or share the RAM on the Macintosh logic board. (This was 1994 when the rule of thumb was $100 a megabyte (MB) for buying RAM.) Not having an extra $800 I opted to share the RAM on the Mac; this setting was stored in the PRAM, a non-volatile random access memory chip. If the DOS Card was assigned too much memory it could prevent the Mac from booting up; you then had to reset the PRAM to get the memory back from the DOS card. To reset the PRAM you had to hold down Command-Option-P-R. The only reason I learned this bit of arcane knowledge was because I had this weird hybrid computer.</p>

In the interview the CEO, Robert Farnsworth, asked me how to reset the PRAM. I told him and he offered me a job. He later said I was the only candidate he interviewed, out of dozens, who could answer that question. As the Technical Support Manager at Sonnet I answered customer support phone calls, approved warranty exchanges and returns, and authored installation instructions and technical documentation. In 1996 I created Sonnet's first web site in Adobe PageMill.</p>

In September, 1998 I was offered a salary position with <strong class="company">Fox Filmed Entertainment</strong> as a <em>Systems Analyst</em>. While working for Fox I got to meet lots of celebrities and Hollywood executives. I traded Filemaker Pro information with Academy Award winner Jon Landau, I fixed Harold Ramis&rsquo;s Powerbook, and travelled to Toronto to set up the X-Men production office.</p>
    <p>In February 1999 I began taking freelance clients on a limited basis providing web design and programming, video post-production, database design, and on-site technical support; working with clients like <a href="http://henson.com" rel="external" class="company">The Jim Henson Company</a>, <a href="http://aubreyco.com" rel="external" class="company">Aubrey &amp; Associates</a> and <a href="https://www.fcb.com/" rel="external" class="company">Foote, Cone &amp; Belding</a></p>
    <p>In August 2000 I started working for <a href="http://www.pathwaycapital.com/" rel="external" class="company">Pathway Capital Management</a> in Irvine, California as a Web Programmer. While at Pathway I learned PHP and rebuilt Pathway&rsquo;s private access, proprietary, private equity financial reporting web-based software suite. I was then cross trained in 4th Dimension, an obscure PASCAL based database language.</p>

Near the completion of the project I was offered a salary position with <strong class="company">AEG Live</strong> as a <em>Web Developer</em>. With the position came the opportunity to work remotely from home; avoiding the long commute from Orange County to the Miracle Mile on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. While at AEG Live I worked on many music related web sites including tour sites for <strong class="artist">Bon Jovi</strong>, <a href="http://www.celineinvegas.com/" rel="external">Celine Dion</a>, and <strong class="artist">Tina Turner</strong>; and venue sites like <a href="http://1stbankcenter.com/" rel="external">1STBANK Center</a> and <a href="http://www.theelrey.com/" rel="external">The El Rey Theatre</a>. In April 2009 I was part of the team that built the web site to announce <strong class="artist">Michael Jackson&rsquo;s</strong> return to the stage at the <a href="https://www.theo2.co.uk/" rel="external">O2 in London</a>. The traffic to the site during the presale was massive (6.2 million hits on announce day, 245,000 uniques). With the help of the server team our site stayed up and running as our associated vendor sites crashed under the traffic load.</p>
    <p>In 2010 I was promoted to <em>Technical Producer</em> in the <strong class="department">AEG Digital</strong> division of <strong class="company">AEG Live&rsquo;s</strong> parent company <a href="http://www.aegworldwide.com" rel="external">AEG Worldwide</a> where I continued to work on websites for AEG properties like <a href="http://www.coachella.com" rel="external">Coachella</a> and&nbsp;the attempted NFL stadium <a href="http://www.farmersfield.com" rel="external">Farmers Field</a>.</p>
    <p>Then, in January 2012, I was transfered to the <strong class="department">AXS Digital</strong> division of <strong class="company">AEG Worldwide</strong> where I was on the launch team for <a href="http://axs.com" rel="external">AXS</a>; a new ticketing brand to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-requires-ticketmaster-entertainment-inc-make-significant-changes-its" rel="exernal">replace Ticketmaster</a> in all AEG owned venues. Our team had to build a custom CMS from the ground up that was capable of handling ticket information across the globe with support for multiple languages (initially British English, American English and Swedish.) We also built a robust API to provide ticket details and availability to all the venue sites and associated vendors. The best thing about working for AXS was all the great people we had on the team (shout out to the team.)</p>

During my time at SMG I have helped to launch a number of new companies including <a href="http://chargeback360.com/" rel="external">Chargeback360</a>, <a href="" rel="external">BrandSlip</a> and <a href="http://pushinnovationlive.com/" rel="external">Push Innovation Live</a>.</p>

The GolfCode 360 project includes the building of my first professional iOS app.</p>
    <p>Of course the reason I do all this is my wonderful family; my wife of {{marriage_age}}, Michelle, and my two beautiful daughters, Taylor ({{taylor_age}}) and Samantha ({{sam_age}}).</p>
